Digitisation workflow for Science Uncovered.


Workflow
========




Step 1: Digitisation
--------------------

Coleoptera curators taking images of Coleoptera and Hemiptera specimens.

Image requirements:

  * Each photo should be of an individual specimen
  * Each photo should have at least one transcribable label
  * Photos should be added to flickr group SU2014
  
[#1](/../../issues/1) The specimen images are a good draw and throughput can be continuous - so use the big screen to display a visualisation of images added to the photostream.  This should be live and dynamic - mounted at height behind the display. 

[#2](/../../issues/2) For the visualisation to look good, the images from the digitsation process should be added to flickr as they are created. Need a pipeline to do this.

[#3](/../../issues/3) Preload images into the flickr group SU2014. 

  

Step 2: Transcription
---------------------

Visitors will transcribe the specimen labels created in step 1.

Transcription tool requirements:

 * Specimens have multiple labels. Users will draw a shape around a label. A text box will then appear, to enter the label value.
 * After a label has been transcribe 3 times, it will be greyed out so user has to select another area. 
 * After label entry is submitted, the user will be encouraged to send a tweet.
  * If on their phone: "I have just  transcribed @nhm_london specimen [linkto flickr photo] #su2014"
  * If using our iPad, tweet will be from @su2014 twitter account ".@username has just transcribed @nhm_london specimen [linkto flickr photo] #su2014"

The transcription app will only  

[#4](/../../issues/4) We will need at least two iPads.

[#5](/../../issues/5) Build transcription app

[#6](/../../issues/6) Set up twitter account to use. 

[#9](/../../issues/9) Live count of transcriptions. Big number going up.

The transcription app will only be accessible within the Museum network.

[#7](/../../issues/7) Use data portal dev VM. Ensure is viewable on wifi network.

Step 3: Data Portal
-------------------

The data will be live pushed to the data portal, providing entry point to discuss the Data Portal.

[#8](/../../issues/8) We will need a local Data Portal to demo, so not accesssible on Museum-wide network.
