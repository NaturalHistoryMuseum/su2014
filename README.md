Digitisation workflow for Science Uncovered.


Workflow
========




Step 1: Digitisation
--------------------

Coleoptera curators taking images of Coleoptera and Hemiptera specimens.

Image requirements:

  * Each photo should be of an individual specimen
  * Each photo should have at least one transcribable label
  * Photos should be added to flickr group SU2014
  
The specimen images are a good draw and throughput can be continuous - so use the big screen to display a visualisation of images added to the photostream.  This should be live and dynamic - mounted at height behind the display. [#1](/../../issues/1)

For the visualisation to work well, the images from the digitsation process should be added to flickr as they are created. Need a process in place to do this. [#2](/../../issues/2) 


  
  
  




Stand 1: Digitsation
