Digitisation workflow for Science Uncovered.


Workflow
========




Step 1: Digitisation
--------------------

Coleoptera curators taking images of Coleoptera and Hemiptera specimens.

Image requirements:

  * Each photo should be of an individual specimen
  * Each photo should have at least one transcribable label
  * Photos should be added to flickr group SU2014
  
[#1](/../../issues/1) The specimen images are a good draw and throughput can be continuous - so use the big screen to display a visualisation of images added to the photostream.  This should be live and dynamic - mounted at height behind the display. 

[#2](/../../issues/2) For the visualisation to look good, the images from the digitsation process should be added to flickr as they are created. Need a pipeline to do this.

[#3](/../../issues/3) Preload images into the flickr group SU2014. 

  
  
  




Stand 1: Digitsation
