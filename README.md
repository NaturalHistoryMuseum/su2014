Digitisation workflow for Science Uncovered.


Workflow
========




Step 1: Digitsation
-------------------

Coleoptera curators taking images of Coleoptera and Hemiptera specimens.

Image requirements:

  * Each photo should be of an individual specimen
  * Each photo should have at least one transcribable label
  * Photos should be added to flickr group SU2014
  
The specimen images are a good draw and throughput can be continuous - so use the big screen to display a visualisation of images added to the photostream.  This should be live and dynamic - mounted at hight behind the display. [#1]
